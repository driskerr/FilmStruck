Analysis of the FS library before it shuts down

On Oct. 26, FilmStruck announced that it would be shutting down in a month's time - on Nov. 29. Movielovers protested and mourned. Many leading critics released lists of films that you should watch on the platform before they are lost.

I am trying to create a project the a) examines what exactly we are losing, b) what films recieved the greatest attention, c) if there was an uptick in FilmStruck viewing habits.

Will be relying on [FilmStruck library](https://www.filmstruck.com/us/watch/browse-all/) and probably [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/tag/filmstruck/diary/) for my analysis.
